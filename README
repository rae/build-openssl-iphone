Script to build OpenSSL for iPhone device and simulator platform
Tested against:
		0.9.8n: SDK 3.1.2 and 3.1.3
		0.9.8q: SDK 4.2
		1.0.0a: SDK 4.2
		1.0.0c: SDK 4.2
		1.0.0d: SDK 4.2

Either:
(a)
	% cd {directory where you've downloaded openssl}
	% bash {path}/build.sh -t openssl-1.0.0d.tgz
(b)
	% tar -zxf openssl-1.0.0d.tgz
	%  bash {path}/build.sh -d openssl-1.0.0d

library should be ready in newly created 'dist' directory. Not quite there yet though. Some manual fiddling is still required.
